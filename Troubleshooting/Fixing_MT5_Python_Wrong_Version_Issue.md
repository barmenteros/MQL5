# Fixing MT5 Python Wrong Version Issue

## Problem Description

You're trying to use Python scripts in MetaTrader 5 (MT5), but you’re encountering issues where the **wrong version of Python** is being used (e.g., Python 3.12 instead of Python 3.9) or Python isn’t initializing correctly. You might see errors like **"python process thread create error"** or **"ModuleNotFoundError"** when running Python scripts in MT5.

## Cause

This issue usually occurs because **Conda** or another virtual environment (with a different Python version, like Python 3.12) is automatically activated whenever you open PowerShell or Command Prompt. MT5 might be picking up this wrong version of Python instead of the version it needs (e.g., Python 3.9 or 3.8). This can cause compatibility issues because MT5 prefers specific Python versions (like 3.9).

## Solution

Let's dive into the step-by-step process to fix this issue and make sure MT5 is using the correct Python version.

## Step-by-Step Troubleshooting Guide

### 1. Identify the Python Version MT5 is Using

First, you need to verify which Python version is being used by your system and MT5.

- Open **PowerShell** or **Command Prompt**.
- Run the following command:
  
  ```bash
  python --version
  ```

If you see Python 3.12 (or another unwanted version), that’s the issue. MT5 might be using the wrong Python version. MT5 generally works better with **Python 3.8 or 3.9**, so we need to set that up.

### 2. Deactivate the Conda Base Environment from Auto-Activating

Conda environments are useful, but they can cause problems when they take over your terminal session and switch the Python version.

- Open PowerShell (or Command Prompt).
- Run this command to **stop Conda from auto-activating the base environment**:

  ```bash
  conda config --set auto_activate_base false
  ```

This prevents the Conda base environment (which might use Python 3.12) from starting every time you open a terminal window.

### 3. Verify the Change

After disabling Conda auto-activation, close PowerShell and open it again. Now, check which version of Python is running by default.

- Run:

  ```bash
  python --version
  ```

If it now shows **Python 3.9** (or another version you want MT5 to use), you’re on the right track!

### 4. Make Sure MT5 Uses the Correct Python Version

MT5 should now use Python 3.9 as the default version. To double-check:

- Open **MetaEditor** in MetaTrader 5.
- Go to **Tools** > **Options** > **Compilers**.
- In the **Python** section, ensure that the path points to the correct Python 3.9 executable, like:

  ```
  C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39
  ```

### 5. Test Your Python Script

Now that everything is set up, let’s test if the Python script is running correctly in MT5:

- Write a simple Python script that prints a message and check if it runs correctly in MT5.
- Attach it to a chart in MT5 and check the **Toolbox \ Experts** tab to see if it logs the message.

Here’s a sample Python script to test:

```python
import MetaTrader5 as mt5

print("Testing MT5 Python script...")

# Initialize MT5
if not mt5.initialize():
    print("MT5 initialization failed.")
    quit()

print("MT5 initialized successfully!")
mt5.shutdown()
```

After running this, you should see messages in the **Experts** tab.

### 6. Still Having Issues? Check for Other Common Problems

If MT5 is still having trouble with Python integration, here are some additional things to check:

- **Permissions**: Make sure you’re running MT5 as **Administrator** (right-click the MT5 icon and choose "Run as Administrator").
- **Correct Python Version**: If you have multiple Python versions installed, make sure the system’s PATH is set up correctly, with Python 3.9 listed first. You can adjust this in the **Environment Variables** section in Windows settings.
- **Missing Python Packages**: If you get errors like `ModuleNotFoundError`, make sure the required Python packages (like MetaTrader5, NumPy, etc.) are installed. Run:

  ```bash
  pip install MetaTrader5 numpy
  ```

### 7. Extra Tip: Activate Conda When Needed

If you need to use Conda environments (e.g., for machine learning), you can still manually activate them when needed.

- To activate the Conda base environment manually, just run:

  ```bash
  conda activate base
  ```

This way, you can keep Conda available without it interfering with MT5’s Python environment.
